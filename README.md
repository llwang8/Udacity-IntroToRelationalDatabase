# Intro to Relational Database

 I learn the basics of SQL (the Structured Query Language) and database design, as well as the Python API for connecting Python code to a database. I also learn a bit about protecting my database-backed web apps from common security problems.

I am able to write code using a database as a backend to store application data reliably and safely.
